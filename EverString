/**
    Given: Array of n elements, integers.
           Array is unsorted, each value is found in array only once.
           Values are supposed to be from 1 to n, but one value is replaced by 0.

    Write a function to find the missing value

    Example:   Array  inputArr elements ==> [10,3,2,0,9,4,6,7,5,1]

               Result: outputInt = 8 //missing value is 8
